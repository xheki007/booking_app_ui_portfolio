# Booking App UI Portfolio (Flutter, Dark Mode)

This is a modern booking app UI built with Flutter, designed to show clean, user-friendly interfaces in dark mode.  
All screens are static and work with demo data only – the purpose is to present my design, code quality, and attention to detail for any future mobile app projects.
